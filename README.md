# Lottery-System-Tezos
A simple lottery system for Tezos blockchain.
This system is a fun yet useful addon to the Tezos blockchain. It adds a reward system for the frequenters to the blockchain and encourages more people to join in. 
This is an in development project, right now, the smart contract has been made with the frontend and backend remaining.
In future prospects of this project, we can calibrate it so that each transaction you make on the Tezos blockchain(no matter how small), acts as an entry to win a lottery. A person may have upto 50 entries(So that people don't exploit it).
This way more and more people will be attracted to Tezos and that opens up a plethora of opportunities like trading games, collecting games, etc., all made possible through the wonderful technology that is blockchain.
